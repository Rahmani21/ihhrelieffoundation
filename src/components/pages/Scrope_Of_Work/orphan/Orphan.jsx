              The majority of children who lose their families, and live without
              any guardian or protection, are in the Muslim world. Human
              traffickers and various criminal organizations are only some of
              the threatening facts that they may have to face. Meanwhile,
              missionary organizations grab millions of children who have no one
              to protect them in Muslim countries and use them for their
              missionary interests.

              As IHH we are trying to care for hundreds of thousands of orphans
              in dozens of countries. We keep working relentlessly to support
              them until they can stand on their own feet and provide for their
              needs, from accommodation to healthcare, education, and food. We
              want them to grow up in their homeland without losing their
              culture and depending on someone else other than their relatives.
              We build orphanages with a cozy home environment for orphans, who
              lost their parents and cannot stay with their relatives.

              We are covering the living expenses of more than 133 thousand
              orphans in 44 countries and 80 cities across Turkey on a monthly
              regular basis and support them in terms of education, healthcare,
              food, and accommodation. Annually, we support nearly more than 1
              million orphans in 120 countries.

                        IHH orphanages serve beyond places of accommodation
                        where orphans sleep in. They are built according to the
                        particular conditions of the region and often hold
                        strategic importance. In some countries, Muslims are
                        oppressed, and their children are unable to receive
                        education in their mother tongue and in Islamic
                        subjects. Orphanages built by IHH in these regions meet
                        both the need for accommodation and education.
                        Orphanages built in Pakistan after a major earthquake
                        were aimed at protecting the children against missionary
                        organizations. IHH orphanages and colleges that evolved
                        into educational institutions are regarded as the most
                        prestigious educational institutions in the country. The
                        education center that opened in 2013 in Somalia, which
                        has been plagued by civil war for the past 20 years,
                        features a school, a mosque, a dormitory, a medical
                        center, and a playground. 1.500 students, including 400
                        boarding students study there. The education center aims
                        to equip children who had to quit school due to civil
                        war or poverty with the necessary skills and
                        qualifications to join society. This is the biggest
                        investment in children, who are the future of the
                        country as it aims to help them..
